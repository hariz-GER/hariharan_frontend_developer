👋 About Me
I’m a Frontend-focused Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience building scalable SaaS and AI-powered applications. I work primarily with React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), and Next.js to create performant, responsive, and user-centric interfaces.
On the backend, I have experience with Node.js, FastAPI, Django, REST APIs, and microservices, along with strong database knowledge in PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. I’ve integrated AI/LLM solutions using OpenAI and Google Gemini APIs, and built WhatsApp chatbot automations using the Meta Business API.
I’ve worked on real-world projects involving third-party integrations such as Razorpay, Shopify, Zoho CRM, Google Sheets, WooCommerce, and Shiprocket, enabling end-to-end business automation.
With a background in Physics and Machine Learning, I bring strong analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and performance optimization mindset to software development. I’m comfortable using Git, GitHub, Docker, Nginx, and CI/CD basics, and I enjoy building clean, maintainable, production-ready code.
🚀 Currently focused on growing as a Frontend / Full-Stack Developer and building impactful products at the intersection of Web + AI.
